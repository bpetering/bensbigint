Ben's BigInt
============

This is my toy C++ bigint library, written to simultaneously learn C++ and arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Hopefully it won't `end up running half the crypto on the Internet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSLeay>`_. :o)

Overview
--------

* No floating-point for now, and probably for ever. *Something about the purity of the integers mutter mutter*
* Some thought to speed
* Test suite, yay

Caveats
-------

* *Toy* library, go use `GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`_ or something for production.
* I have no idea what I'm doing
